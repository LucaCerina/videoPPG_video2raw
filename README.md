# videoPPG-converter
Tool that identifies ROIs on human faces and extract raw signal for videoPPG identification.

## Dependencies
* QT Creator (tested on v5.7) with compiler to build the project
* OpenCV (tested on v3.1) library
The .pro file should be modified to point to the correct OpenCV folder
